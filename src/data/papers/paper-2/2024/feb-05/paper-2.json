You have to take the given statements to be true even if they seem to be at variance with commonly known facts. Read all the conclusions and then decide which of the given conclusions logically follows from the given statements, disregarding commonly known facts. Statements: Some pink are not yellow. All orange are pink. Some green are yellow. Conclusions: I. All orange are green. II. Some pink are not orange is a possibility.",

        },
        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "From the statements, we know all orange are pink, but no direct relation between orange and green, so I does not follow. However, it is possible that some pink are not orange, as the statements do not say all pink are orange. So conclusion II (possibility) follows."
