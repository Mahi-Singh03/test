Volume = (1/3) × (22/7) × (3.5)² × 9 = (1/3) × (22/7) × 12.25 × 9 = (1/3) × (22 × 12.25 × 9) / 7 = (1/3) × (22 × 110.25) / 7 = (1/3) × (2425.5) / 7 = (1/3) × 346.5 = 115.5 m³. Since 1 m³ = 1000 litres, capacity = 115.5 × 1000 = 115500 litres. Oil left after filling tank = 120000 - 115500 = 4500 litres.

However, the answer key provided is A: 4800. There might be a miscalculation in the original key. Let's re-evaluate step by step: r=3.5, r²=12.25, πr²=(22/7)*12.25 = 22*1.75=38.5. Height=9, so πr²h=38.5*9=346.5. Cone volume = (1/3)*346.5=115.5 m³ = 115500 L. Remaining = 120000-115500=4500 L. So correct answer is 4500, option B.)"

Expression: 1.25 - 0.45 + 1.25 - 0.45 + 3.75 - 0.5 - 0.05 = (1.25+1.25+3.75) - (0.45+0.45+0.5+0.05) = (6.25) - (1.45) = 4.80 ≈ 4.8, which is not an integer. Let's recalc carefully: 1.25 - 0.45 = 0.8; 0.8 + 1.25 = 2.05; 2.05 - 0.45 = 1.6; 1.6 + 3.75 = 5.35; 5.35 - 0.5 = 4.85; 4.85 - 0.05 = 4.8. So value is 4.8. The closest integer is 5, but the options are integers. There might be an error in the question or options. The answer key says C:4, which might be rounding down or a miscalculation in the original. However, 4.8 is not exactly any option. Let's check if the expression is grouped differently? Possibly the expression is meant to be: (5/4 - 0.45) + (5/4 - 0.45) + (3.75 - 1/2 - 0.05) = 0.8 + 0.8 + (3.75 - 0.5 - 0.05) = 1.6 + 3.2 = 4.8. Still 4.8.
